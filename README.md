# password
I created The file of the HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript. 
Then started to make the HTML so the information that I need to show is showing. 
When the HTML was finished I when and did the CSS. 
Doing the CSS, I put all the informaton of the HTML to look pretty and also put some colors. 
And to finish I did the JavaScript.
Doing the JavaScript I made the generte password work and many other things. 

When I was doing this homework. I was working with Jose Guerrero and youtube tutorial.
